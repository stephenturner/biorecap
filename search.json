leverages multi-relational Graph Neural Networks and text knowledge to improve biomedical predictions by initializing nodes using informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration of various data types and improved generalizability. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional single-relation approaches in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes, particularly in identifying disease-gene associations and drug-phenotype relationships, and shows promising results in accurately inferring drug side effects without direct training on such data. | #> +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #> | [High-throughput bacterial aggregation analysis in droplets](http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.09.24.613170v1?rss=1)                                                   | The communal lifestyle of bacteria can contribute significantly to antimicrobial resistance by promoting biofilm formation.
